# visualiser
A web tool for visualising promoter sequences of DNA.

To be honest I can't really remember what it's meant to do exactly but it still works and looks pretty so I made it its own repo.

A live version can be viewed at [http://alexjbest.github.io/visualiser/GeneView.html](http://alexjbest.github.io/visualiser/GeneView.html).
